# PWM-8051
PWM or Pulse Width Modulation is very commonly used in control systems today.It basically means, varying the width of a pulse (not frequency).
Here, it is used to get analog results from digital means. The digital control is used to create square wave i.e a signal switched between on and off and to get varying analog values, modulate the pulse width.

The code describes how to control the brightness of led and speed of motor by varying PW using embedded c (for 8051 microcontroller).
